*Regarding this package*

I could not get Heiko's Accessus from bintray (it was asking my credentials), so I just copied the code over here.

All rights belong to Heiko Seeberger of course, and I'm thankful for his help.

OTOH, in the future I may as well contribute something here; I promise to send the proper pull request to Heiko in such a case.
